an ancient one borne of the silver that rose above chaos before time began 

notes: 
they have two main aspects the red and silver moon and ties to another god the lord of red skies 

> [!danger] the red moon
> the red moon brought flesh and madness into the world , they twist reality in unselttling ways , much like the shadows of night hide the forms of what was before. the red moon is worshiped only by those who invite the twisted flesh of skies for its power, but though they may be few they are devoted and fanatical about their mission to bring power to the moon prescence and usher in an age of the red sky 

>[!quote] the silver moon 
> the silver moon is the aspect of the light side of the moon , they are without blood ,and are a benevolent deity. they create groves of stone and water rather than flesh and do not have as devoted a cult. there still are those who worship the silver moon , especially those visited by effigies of the goddess. they hold a strong connection to tides and water and are generally more powerful than their brother/ other half  except on nights of the new moon or during twillights
