geography of chaos




in the south of the labyrinth the ruins break the earth , and so low do they reach that the pass each of its nine circles and stand outside it, thereof , it of the only land in all the worlds where mortals cannot die and chaos can be seen. in this place is hung summer twilight , low and golden whereupon the fey folk live. in this place wanderers seek refuge from the the lands above, and passage to that which lies below. beneath the southern lands is a great stone forest where the bodies of titans rest. it is there that all of the old gods reside and only there can the outer ones be communed. 


in the west is the only passage to the outer world. past the passage is a small town of mostly aged folk who stay to guar the gates with sigils and seals. there now lives a priestess who is part fey - with hair as gold as wheat and skin like milk. she was born after the widow of tktk in grief wished for a child and asked the wise woman who sent her after a white rose which when eaten would have her birth a fair child who would never fall ill or troubled. she did not say this to the mother but the flower was a driadic nymph of the gentle tktk who was most skilled in the arts of warding which was needed to keep the seal on the labyrinth. for this reason the feygirl now studies tirelessly to learn the arts herself and remake the seals upon the labyrinth , for her family was sworn to keep the lands of the far west free of the beasts of the silent theif. 




in the north the ruins are sparse and open to fields of amber light, an endless plane of graves and flowers. there you will find the pale mourner in the cavern of tktk who has sat there since the battle of tktk. it is a land of twilight fall , and in the skies stretch three moons
